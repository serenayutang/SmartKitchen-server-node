## About API

[Apple Services Performance Partners](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)

All Patreon supporters have access to the beta version of the API which allows mutiple ingredient filters.
You also get access to adding your own meals and images. You can also list the full database rather than limited to 100 items. You can use the test API key "1" during development of your app or for educational use(see test links below)
However you must apply for a key a production API key via email if releasing publicly on an appstore.
The test key may be revoked at any time if abused.
